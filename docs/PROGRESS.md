# Veyntro — current progress

DATE/TIME (UTC): 2026-11-02T21:05:47.503182+00:00
PHASE / MILESTONE: Phase 2 — Commitment Firewall implemented and tested locally; live lifecycle pending
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
LAST VERIFIED COMMIT: 9aa5212c66f8867e8f315625c8d197cee7844750 (source baseline before this change).
REPOSITORY: https://github.com/0xaje/Veyntro
NETWORK / CONTRACT IDS: testnet; DAO veyntro.sputnikv2.testnet; council aje-veyntro.testnet; receiver receiver.aje-veyntro.testnet verified. Firewall, verifier and beneficiary accounts NOT CREATED/DEPLOYED by this session.

## Source of truth and completed milestones

Read master plan version 1.2, AGENTS.md and authoritative GitHub progress before coding. Phase 1 is independently VERIFIED: creation, proposal 0, council approval, actual 0.01 NEAR receipt from DAO to receiver and rejected direct council call with unchanged ledger. Full previous progress is preserved in docs/PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md and real receipt files remain in evidence/. Do not repeat Phase 1 writes or replace its receiver.

## Phase 2 work completed locally

- New contracts/commitment-firewall, separate from the deployed receiver. DAO-only funding/reservation/cancellation/withdrawal/verifier rotation; beneficiary-only payouts to immutable recipients; permissionless expiry.
- Checked accounting: DAO accountable funds, storage/gas reserve, remaining liabilities INCLUDING pending payouts, pending uncommitted withdrawals, conservative actual-balance cap. Deployment/direct-transfer balances are not free accountable funds.
- Pending transfer operations, private typed callbacks, exactly one bounded native-transfer result, exactly-once settlement, failure recovery and cancellation/expiry interleavings. Missing/failed callbacks stay encumbered; no invented reconciliation success.
- Drawdown and DAO withdrawal nonces prevent replay. A failed transfer consumes its nonce; retries use a new nonce.
- Fixed evidence slots; verifier-only expiring policy-matched attestations with nonce/epoch checks. Rotation invalidates unspent old attestations. Real GitHub API service is NOT implemented here.
- Future operation storage reserved up front: 32 attempts per commitment, 1024 bytes each, actual growth checked. Unused allowance released on close. See docs/FIREWALL_ACCOUNTING.md for costs/limits and docs/FIREWALL_API.md for parameters.
- Paginated public views and actual-state events. No UI redesign, frontend, fake balances or hosted product was added.

## Verification commands and actual results

PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" bash scripts/build-firewall.sh — exit 0. Formatting passed; 56 firewall tests and 9 receiver tests passed; Clippy with -D warnings passed; locked WASM release build passed using --cfg near.

Rust 1.95.0; near-sdk 5.30.0; existing lockfile updated only for the new workspace member. WASM 219782 bytes, SHA256 a850073c270245b74668bf692f3fcc9a763ed791f94b4786427cbb39dfc4862a. This local build is not claimed independently reproducible. The user's deployed receiver hash remains separately recorded.

CI workflow added with immutable checkout revision, read-only contents permission and pinned project Rust toolchain. CI has NOT been claimed passed; check the actual run after publication. Third-party quality/design skill files were not found in the refreshed local skill locations; no skill-specific audit is claimed. Manual review identified and fixed prepaid payment storage and withdrawal replay issues.

Evidence: evidence/FIREWALL_BUILD.json; evidence/firewall-build.log; evidence/FIREWALL_CHECK_ATTEMPTS.md. Local SDK harness tests are development checks, not real blockchain or GitHub activity.

## Remaining live gates / risks

- New full-contract account, separate verifier and beneficiary accounts; funding plan using actual testnet balances and free faucet only. Candidate names firewall-aje-veyntro.testnet, verifier-aje-veyntro.testnet, worker-aje-veyntro.testnet returned UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT at block 275952357 (availability observation only). No keys generated in this workspace.
- Deployment and generated ABI guard checks; real DAO funding and two commitments; rejected overcommitment; real evidence-backed payout; failed/retried transfer; expiry release; callbacks/final receipts and public numerical reconciliation. None is verified yet for the firewall.
- Full-access deployment key authority and callback liveness/recovery need review. A stuck callback remains pending rather than releasing funds. No security-audit or trustless-custody claim.
- Storage reserve is conservative and includes future operation slots. Pending refunds/settlement may temporarily pause new actions. Withdrawing the exact displayed capacity can need extra operation storage margin.
- GitHub verifier service, wallet frontend, hosting, indexing and operator remain unimplemented. Phase 0 detailed competitor coverage and Nigeria/prize/KYC confirmation remain open; do not claim those resolved.

## Next exact action

1. Publish this verified source and evidence, then user pulls main in ~/Veyntro-build and runs bash scripts/build-firewall.sh. Record user's actual artifact hash.
2. User creates NEW firewall-aje-veyntro.testnet through the free CLI faucet, keeping keys locally. Verify creation/final receipts and balance; do not deploy over the receiver.
3. Establish separate actual verifier and beneficiary accounts, review contract/key authority and live funding amounts, then prepare initialization and DAO funding proposals from real state.
4. Keep Phase 2 IN_PROGRESS until its entire real testnet financial lifecycle and final evidence gate pass. No more receiver writes are needed.
